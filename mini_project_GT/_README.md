This repository contains the R project and the files for the mini-project on reproducibility in the Living Data Project course on Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution.

In the main repository, we can find a folder for raw data (00_rawdata) in read-only; a folder for r scripts (01_scripts) containing a subfolder for secondary scripts (r_scripts) and another one for the main script in R markdown (RMD_scripts); a folder for output data (02_outdata); a folder for figures (03_figures) and a folder for the manuscript of the related article (04_manuscript).
