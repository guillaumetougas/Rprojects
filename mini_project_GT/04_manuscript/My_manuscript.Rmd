## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Methods

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

<!-- Adding already made plot from the 03_figures directory" -->

<!-- ![](../03_figures/plot.png) -->

[@nordt2021]

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
