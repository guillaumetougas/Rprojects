  abstract = {Abstract Changes in phenology induced by climate change occur across the globe with important implications for ecosystem functioning and services, species performance and trophic interactions. Much of the work on phenology, especially leaf out and flowering, has been conducted on woody plant species. Less is known about the responses in phenology of herbaceous species induced by global change even though they represent a large and important part of biodiversity worldwide. A globally coordinated research effort is needed to understand the drivers and implications of such changes and to predict effects of global change on plant species phenology and related ecosystem processes. Here, we present the rationale of the PhenObs initiative?botanical gardens as a global phenological observation network. The initiative aims to collect data on plant phenology in botanical gardens which will be used alongside information on plant traits and site conditions to answer questions related to the consequences of global change: What is the variation in plant phenology in herbaceous species across the growing season and in response to changes in climate? How can plant phenology be predicted from species? trait composition, provenance, position and extent of the distribution range and species? phylogeny? What are the implications of this variation with respect to species performance and assembly, biotic interactions (e.g. plant?pollinator interactions) as well as ecosystem processes and services under changing land use and climate? Here, we lay out the development of a straightforward protocol that is appropriate for monitoring phenology across a vast diversity of growth forms of herbaceous species from various habitats and geographical regions. To focus on a key number of stages necessary to capture all aspects of plant species phenology, we analysed associations between 14 phenological stages. These data were derived from a 2-year study on 199 species in four German botanical gardens. Based on the relationships of the phenological stages, we propose to monitor three vegetative stages (?initial growth?, ?leaves unfolding? and ?senescence?) and two reproductive stages (?flowers open? and ?ripe fruits?) to fully capture herbaceous species phenology.

  abstract = {Botanical gardens make unique contributions to climate change research, conservation, and public engagement. They host unique resources, including diverse collections of plant species growing in natural conditions, historical records, and expert staff, and attract large numbers of visitors and volunteers. Networks of botanical gardens spanning biomes and continents can expand the value of these resources. Over the past decade, research at botanical gardens has advanced our understanding of climate change impacts on plant phenology, physiology, anatomy, and conservation. For example, researchers have utilized botanical garden networks to assess anatomical and functional traits associated with phenological responses to climate change. New methods have enhanced the pace and impact of this research, including phylogenetic and comparative methods, and online databases of herbarium specimens and photographs that allow studies to expand geographically, temporally, and taxonomically in scope. Botanical gardens have grown their community and citizen science programs, informing the public about climate change and monitoring plants more intensively than is possible with garden staff alone. Despite these advances, botanical gardens are still underutilized in climate change research. To address this, we review recent progress and describe promising future directions for research and public engagement at botanical gardens.},

  abstract = {With steep climatic gradients over short distances, montane ecosystems provide exceptional opportunities to study ecological responses to climate and other environmental changes. Here we present a summary and synthesis of 10 years of research on this theme in a protected area in southern Qu{\'e}bec, Canada (Parc National du Mont M{\'e}gantic), with ecological conditions closely similar to the northern Appalachians. During the {$\sim$}150 years since European settlement, anthropogenic disturbance has reduced the abundance of certain taxa (e.g., Picea [spruce]), while favoring other taxa that thrive during succession (e.g., Betula [birch], Acer [maple]). In more recent decades, climate warming ({$\sim$}0.21 {$^\circ$}C per decade) appears to have prompted upward elevational range shifts for many plant species, although such responses lag behind changes in climate itself. Experimental studies with seeds and seedlings of Acer saccharum (Sugar Maple) suggest that upward range expansion might be constrained by non-climatic factors such as belowground properties and seed predators, while escape from insect herbivores might actually accelerate range expansion. Similar studies with understory plants have not revealed clear evidence of non-climatic constraints on range limits, although some preliminary data presented here suggest a possible role of a lack of microsites with rich, moist soil at high elevation. Current studies focus on the lower elevational range limits of species restricted to mountaintops, such as certain lichens. Vegetation and flowering phenology are also sensitive to climate, and we have found that earlier springs are associated with decreased potential gene flow across populations at different elevations; ongoing studies will determine how differential sensitivity of herbs vs. trees might influence the duration of a high light period in spring in the understory. Overall, we have found clear signals of plant responses to long-term anthropogenic disturbances and recent climatic warming, but considerable uncertainty remains about how climatic and non-climatic factors will interact to determine the future of this montane ecosystem.}
