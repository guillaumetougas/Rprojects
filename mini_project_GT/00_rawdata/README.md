# README file

In the "00_rawdata" folder, all raw data is extracted directly from the source of the PhenObs 2022 dataset (URL:https://idata.idiv.de/ddm/Data/DownloadZip/3550?version=6276). The data is downloaded as a zipfile (phenObs.zip) and then unzipped by the r script "rawdata_import.R" in the "01_scripts/r_scripts" folder.


The real raw data is found within the document "rawdata_PhenObs_2022(1).csv", containing measures of species' phenology in different botanical gardens. An already processed dataset with filtered information is also available within the document "processeddata_PhenObs_2022(1)".

In this directory, you can find the metadata information in the following files :

- metadata_rawdata_PhenObs_2022(1).csv
- metadata_processeddata_PhenObs_2022(1).csv
- 3550_33_metadata.html #A web version

Please read the DATA_DICTIONARY for more specific information on the raw data.
