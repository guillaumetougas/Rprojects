# README file

All important information about the R Project (raw data, scripts, output data, figures, manuscript) is within the mini_project_GT folder. Except for this folder, only some files and folders that helped set up git and the renv package will be found in this directory.

The renv.lock file here only refers to the need of having downloaded the renv package (version 1.0.7).
